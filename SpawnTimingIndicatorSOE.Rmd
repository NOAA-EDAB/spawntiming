Mark Wuenschel provided the data and code to produce the figures from working papers on spawning phenology of haddock and yellowtail flounder stocks.

Mark's input data and code are in this repo.

I just ran Mark's code and will save them as rds files for input into ecodata.

## Yellowtail

Input data: [`YT_63_23_BTS.csv`]()

Processing code: [`YT_Prop_Mat_by_temp_week_timeblocks_CC_WP.R`]()

I ran the code from lines 1:219 to get the datasets. 

Data for percent by spawning stage along with bottom temperature and day of sampling are in `data5`
